Light that reaches Earth from the Moon
For other uses, see
Moonlight (disambiguation)
.
Earthlight illuminates the dim side of the Moon, while direct sunlight illuminates the bright side.
Moonlight
(or
moonshine
) is light from the surface of the
Moon
, consisting mostly of reflected
sunlight
, and some
earthlight
.

History
[
edit
]
The ancient Greek philosopher
Anaxagoras
noted that "
the sun provides the moon with its brightness
".
[
2
]
Ancient Chinese polymath
Zhang Heng
concluded that the light of the moon comes from the Sun. He writes in his treatise,
The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe
, that the Sun and Moon are "like fire and water", where the Sun "gives out light", and the Moon "reflects it".
[

Nyctalopia
was called "moonblink" and thought to be caused by sleeping in moonlight in the tropics as late as the 19th century,
[
4
]
but is actually caused by a deficiency in
Vitamin A
. Moonlight was historically thought to cause
equine recurrent uveitis
, which was called "moon blindness".

Moonmilk
, a soft white limestone precipitate found in caves, was thought to be caused by the rays of the Moon.
[

]
Selenoplexia
was a supposed medical condition caused by the rays of the moon.
[

Illumination
[
edit
]
Moonlight illuminates a lake and surroundings.
The color of moonlight appears bluish or silvery to the
human eye
compared to other, brighter light sources, however this is an illusion, due to the
Purkinje effect
: the spectrum has slightly more long-wavelength (red) light than daylight,
[
7
]
but is almost the same as that of the sun.
[
8
]
The intensity of moonlight varies greatly depending on the
lunar phase
, with the
full moon
typically providing about 0.05–0.1
lux
illumination.
[
9
]
When a full Moon at
perigee
(a "
supermoon
") is viewed around upper
culmination
from the
tropics
, the
illuminance
can reach up to 0.32 lux.
[
9
]
From Earth, the
apparent magnitude
of the full Moon is only about
1
⁄
380,000
that of the
Sun
.
[

The Moon's
Bond albedo
averages 0.136,
[
10
]
meaning only 13.6% of incident sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface. Moonlight takes approximately 1.26 seconds to reach Earth's surface. Moonlight is
scattered by particles
in the
atmosphere of Earth
, which increases the
brightness
of the
night sky
, and decreases
contrast
between dimmer stars and the background. For this reason, many
astronomers
usually avoid
observing
the sky around a full moon.

Lunar eclipse
[
edit
]
Composite image of the
April 2014 total lunar eclipse
from
Charleston, West Virginia
, United States.
A
lunar eclipse
is an
astronomical event
that occurs when the
Moon
moves into the
Earth's shadow
, causing the moonlight to be darkened.
[
11
]
Such an alignment occurs during an
eclipse season
, approximately every six months, during the
full moon
phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to
the plane of the Earth's orbit
.
When the Moon is totally eclipsed by the Earth (a "deep eclipse"),
[
12
]
[
13
]
it takes on a reddish color that is caused by the planet when it completely blocks direct
sunlight
from reaching the Moon's surface, as the only light that is
reflected
from the lunar surface is what has been
refracted
by the
Earth's atmosphere
. This light appears reddish due to the
Rayleigh scattering
of blue light, the same reason sunrises and sunsets are more orange than during the day.
Folklore
[
edit
]
Moonlight sometimes thought to have a harmful influence in folklore. For example, sleeping in the light of a full moon was believed to transform a person into a
werewolf
. The light of the Moon was thought to worsen the symptoms of
lunatics
, and to sleep in moonlight could make one blind, or mad.

Katie Paterson
produced a display at
The Guggenheim
in 2008, entitled
Light bulb to Simulate Moonlight
, which consisted of 289 lightbulbs coated to produce a similar spectrum to the light of the full Moon.
